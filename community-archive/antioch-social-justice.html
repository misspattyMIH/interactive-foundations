      Whether you're new to Antioch or just visiting, ALL ARE WELCOME. People that have lived here "longer" are NOT superior to any other community member. I had no idea, what racist roots have existed in this little city. I had no idea how many police officers have gotten away with murder. I still don't know. One thing is certain, the portraits above are victims that have been killed by law enforcement, here in Antioch, California. From left to right: Josh Peterson, Rakeem Rucks, Lloyd Harris, Wendell Celestine, David Lopez, Charles Burns, Angelo Quinto, Denny Gonzalez, Nathan Gregory Banks, Luis Gongora-Pat, and Arturo Gomez Calel (not pictured). All murdered in Antioch, with the exception of Luis Gongorta-Pat, Officer Michael Mellone murdered him in San Francisco and then transferred to the Antioch Police Department.
    
      <br>
      <br>

      It wasn't until the summer of 2020, when the Murder of George Floyd activated something in me, and many others. This fight for social change has been going on for a lot longer. It's better to join the movement late, than never at all. I started listening to the Antioch Unified School District Meetings, and the Antioch City Council meetings. I planned with short notice my first "hyphy train" protest. I connected with and met a number of activists and community leaders that I'm still in contact with, that helped gather information to make available for all to see. I also began some research via social media on a local blog page, becoming familiar with the names of people posting hateful, and racist remarks. At some point, someone granted me and a few others access to a private "Antioch Back the Blue" page. This is where all the key players of people organzing to harass, threaten, and assault people of color or any activists seeking reform were evident. The same group of people consistantly write in to a local hateful blog page to "recall" African American elected officials, are also the associates of multiple past and present Antioch Police officers or current and former elected officials. 
      <br>
      <br>
    

      Something happened this past election, though. Many people voted for the first time. Antioch made history, for the first time, we have three African American elected officials that now proportionately represent our community. They too, are now under similar attacks. However, more and more community members are paying attention and connecting the dots as I have, as you can read in the article links posted below.
      <br> 
      <br>
    
      
      Antioch, CA, was once a "sundown town". This meant that the Asian community that built our bridge and railroad, had to live in community underground and out of sight once the sun went down. The African American community had to be away from sight at sundown as well. Here we are in 2021, living is such a diverse community with people from all over the Bay Area. That's what makes America what it is. 
      <br>
      <br>
  
    
     In publishing information for the Antioch community, it is important for us to never forget the lives lost, and the must needed changes we need to seek reform for the improvement of our community. We need to seek proper representation of the changes our community needs by continuing to elect the public officials that will get it done. Our current administration has already began the movement to much needed reform to include a 24 hour mental health team, transparency from the police department, 100% body and dash cameras on the police officers, and the demilitarization of our police department. It is happening because the majority of the community is speaking up, myself included.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      It is crucial, for our community to be aware and  to achknolwedge the racist rhetoric that exists here in Antioch, and the racist trends of targeting elected officials to silence or recall them, all who happen to be African American. Take a moment to read just a few comments some of the community members of Antioch have posted in the screen shots below with intent to bully and silence community members. Many of the "old school" Antioch community, have felt threatened by the amount of diverse cultures that have moved to Antioch, and it shows. I have an archive zipfile of 200+ screen shots available for download below.

     <p>Please note, the editor of EastCounty.net changed the image of Councilwoman Tamisha Walker in the link above. In the next link under "Community Coming Together" you can see the original imagery he used, as well as screen shots of the racist rhetoric that ensued after his intentional blog post. Also, the Editor of blog page EastCounty.net, Mike Burkholder runs the podcast of the video posted at the top of the page with Ken Turnage who was voted "Antioch Citizen of the Year" in 2015, but also removed as Antioch Planning Commissioner in May of 2020. Mike Burkholder's friends at the Antioch Unified School District also inappropriately used fund for this blog page to write "positive news", despite the statistics that really matter.

      There is a good fight happening, CHANGE IS HAPPENNING! Our community leaders and comunity members are coming together to call out, expose, and denounce the hateful blog and people that intentionally target, harrass, and assault community members, leaders, activists, and elected officials. Community members are actively participating in city council meetings and outweighing the hateful/ racist attacks. Antioch Community, please take a listen to the videos shared by East County North Star and how the African American Community has been affected by systematic racism.
