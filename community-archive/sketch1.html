      Hello, my name is Patricia, and have been living in Antioch since 1998. I had no idea, what racist roots have been in this little city. I had no idea how many police officers have gotten away with murder. I still don't know. One thing is certain, is the portraits on top are victims that have been killed by law enforcement, here in Antioch, California, with the exception of Luis Gongorta-Pat. Officer Michael Mellone murdered that homeless man in San Francisco and transferred to the Antioch Police Department.

      It wasn't until the summer of 2020, when the Murder of George Floyd activated something in me. I started listening to the Antioch Unified School District Meetings, and the Antioch City Council meetings. I planned with short notice my first "hyphy train" protest. I connected with and met a number of activists and community leaders that I'm still in contact with. I also began some research via social media on a local blog page, becoming familiar with the names of people posting hateful, and racist remarks. At some point, someone granted me and a few others access to a private "Antioch Back the Blue" page. This is where all the key players of people organzing to harass, threaten, and assault people of color or any activists seeking reform were evident. The same people writing into a local hateful blog page to "recall" Africal American elected officials, are also the associates of multiple past and present Antioch Police officers or current and former elected officials.

      Something happened this past election, though. Many people voted for the first time. Antioch made history, for the first time, we have three African American elected officials. They too, are now under similar attacks. However, more and more community members are paying attention and connecting the dots as I have, as you can read in the article links posted below.

      Antioch, CA, was once a "sundown town". This meant that the Asian community that built our bridge and railroad, had to live in community underground and out of sight once the sun went down. The African American community had to be away from sight at sundown as well. Here we are in 2021, living is such a diverse community with people from all over the Bay Area. That's what makes America what it is.

      Many of the "old school" Antioch community, have felt threatened by the amount of diverse cultures that have moved to Antioch, and it shows. I have an archive zipfile of 200+ screen shots that I plan to make accessible here as well.

     In publishing information for the Antioch community, it is important for us to never forget the lives lost, and the must needed changes we need to seek reform for the improvement of our community. We need to seek proper representation of the changes our community needs by continuing to elect the public officials that will get it done. Our current administration has already began the movement to much needed reform to include a 24 hour mental health team, transparency from the police department, 100% body and dash cameras on the police officers, and the demilitarization of our police department. It is happening because the majority of the community is speaking up, myself included.

      It is crucial, for our community to be aware and  to achknolwedge the racist rhetoric that exists here in Antioch, and the racist trends of targeting elected officials, all who happen to be African American. Take a moment to read just a few comments some of the community members have posted in the screen shots below.

      There is a good fight happening, where community members are coming together to call out, expose, and denounce the hateful pages and people that intentionally target, harrass, and assault community members, leaders, activists, and elected officials.
